# CORE-Dev-Build-0.2
CORE is a 2D Game programming library built using C++. It provides a central context for dynamically loading assets and entities and a component based entity system that allows the user to implement wide varieties of content and behavior without inflexible and limiting class hierarchies.

It provides classes and support for dynamic definition and loading of content. Entities can be defined in *.xml files using a hierarchy of nested xml nodes. CORE also supports animation, sound, responsive GUI's, collision detection, and object prototyping. The next steps in development are to continue defining the central entity class and improving inter-process communication between components belonging to the same entity.
